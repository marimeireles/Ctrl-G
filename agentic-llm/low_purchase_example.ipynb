    "\n",
    "The cell below uses an implementation of CtrlG's DFA in order to implement the following four example scenarios in which an agent is faced with a final purchase decision. The agent is limited by a 100USD budget set by the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(\"I want to buy this laptop\", 75.0),           # succeed\n",
    "(\"Let's buy this car\", 25000.0),               # block\n",
    "(\"I need to purchase groceries\", 45.0),        # succeed\n",
    "(\"Just looking around the store today\", 0.0)   # ignore\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These sentences are a mock example of an agent's task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the agent received a prompt by the user, navigated the internet, found a webpage, navigated it successfully and is now about to make the final purchase. The aforementioned `<|PURCHASE REQUEST|>` token is identified by the `[' buy', ' purchase', 'buy', 'purchase', 'buy ', 'purchase ']` tokens. These are the tokens that trigger the DFA, or the initial state of a DFA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last cell of this notebook implements a simpler version of this example that doesn't use DFAs. It relies on simple Python code. In this specific simple example it seems to me like they're equivalent, meaning one wouldn't have to rely on DFAs to make a secure transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might still want to use DFAs when dealing with real users in order to make sure the LLM is outputing the exact information we expect it to. Or we might check this with code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect that not all cases will have to be dealt with DFAs and that they will be most useful for contextual use of the agent in the web, rather than very specific interactions like this one."
